<p>
Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal
approach to software engineering: the process of developing a more
detailed design or implementation from an abstract specification
through a sequence of steps that maintain
correctness with respect to the original specification. Refinement
forms the foundation for verification in a range of application areas,
including distributed and concurrent systems, cyber-physical systems,
autonomous systems, and other safety-critical applications.  
<p> 
 

The aim of this <a href="http://www.bcs-facs.org/">BCS FACS</a>
Refinement Workshop is to bring
together people who are interested in the development of more concrete
designs or executable programs from abstract specifications using
formal notations, tool support for formal software development, and
practical experience with formal refinement methodologies. 
<p>

The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, and discussion of common ground and key differences.
Topics of interest include:

<ul>
  <li> Simulation techniques
  <li> Foundations and semantics
  <li> Case studies (specification and verification)
  <li> Compositional and modular reasoning
  <li> Object-orientation
  <li> Time, probability and hybrid systems
  <li> Specification notations
  <li> Programming models
  <li> Verification and tool support
  <li> Refinement and testing
</ul>

<h2> Proceedings </h2>

<!-- Papers are fully refereed prior to the workshop will be published -->
<!-- in <a href="http://about.eptcs.org">Electronic Proceedings in -->
<!-- Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)</a>, an open-access publisher. -->
<!-- <p> -->

  REFINE 2019 invites high quality papers reporting on opinions, approaches, experiences, and empirical studies related to the topic of teaching Formal Methods. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members. The proceedings will be published as an LNCS volume, either as part of the FM Satellite Events LNCS proceedings or as a separate LNCS volume. (The exact nature of the proceedings will depend on the number of accepted papers.)<br><br>
      
      
It is anticipated that selected papers from this workshop will be
published in extended versions in a special edition of a major
international journal, in line with the special issues in FACJ and SCP
that have appeared for workshop editions since 2003.   


<h2>Key dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Paper submission: June 30, 2019
  <li>Notification: July 31, 2019
  <li>Proceedings version ready: Sept 2, 2019
  <li>Workshop: October 7, 2019
  </ul>
  

<h2>Submission</h2>




    All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; we suggest to use the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, available in llncs2e.zip and the typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip as a template for your contribution). Papers should not exceed 15 pages in length. Submissions should be made using the REFINE 2019 Easychair web site (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=refine2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=refine2019</a>).

    
    All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop. Their authors must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by an early date, to be indicated by the FM 2019 organizers, and present the paper.

<h2>History of the workshop</h2>


This is the 19th Refinement Workshop and would continue a long
tradition in refinement workshops run under the auspices of the
British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest group. Running
since 1988, previous refinement workshops have been held at Cambridge,
London, Bath etc. 
<p>
 

In 1998 the BCS refinement workshop was combined with the Australasian
Refinement Workshop to form the International Refinement Workshop,
hosted alongside Formal Methods Pacific 1998 at The Australian
National University. In 2002, the Refinement Workshop was held as an
FME workshop in Copenhagen. This and six subsequent editions (Surrey,
Macau, Oxford, Turku, Eindhoven, Limerick) have had proceedings in
ENTCS or EPTCS and a subsequent journal special issue (most in Formal
Aspects of Computing, one in Science of Computer Programming). 
<p>
 

The workshop has been co-located at a number of different conferences
in its history, most recently at FM in 2018 (Oxford), FM in 2015 (Norway) and iFM in 2013
(Pisa).
