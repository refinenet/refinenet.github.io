<p style="text-align:center;">
 12 April 2005, co-located with ZB 2005
<br/>REFINE 2005 - BCS FACS - EPSRC RefineNet
</p>
<hr/>

<p>Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal approach to software
 engineering: the process of developing a more detailed design or
 implementation from an abstract specification through a sequence of
 mathematically-based steps that maintain correctness with respect to the
 original specification.</p>

<p>The aim of this BCS FACS Refinement Workshop, organised by the EPSRC
 supported <a href="http://www.refinenet.org.uk/">RefineNet network</a> is
to bring together
 people who are interested in the development of more concrete designs or
 executable programs from abstract specifications using formal notations,
 tool support for formal software development, and practical experience
 with formal refinement methodologies.</p>

<p>The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of 
ideas, and discussion of common ground and key differences.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Simulation techniques</li>
<li>Foundations and semantics</li>
<li>Case studies (specification and verification)</li>
<li>Compositional and modular reasoning</li>
<li>Object-orientation</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Specification notations</li>
<li>Programming models</li>
<li>Verification and tool support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proceedings</h2>

<p> Submissions will be reviewed, and workshop proceedings will appear in
 Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science. BCS-FACS will provide a
 best paper prize.
 An agreement in principle has been reached with the journal Formal Aspects
 of Computing to produce a special issue, consisting of developments and
 extensions of the best workshop papers. These would be refereed in the
 usual fashion prior to acceptance by the journal.</p>

<h2>Key Dates</h2>

<p>The Refinement workshop will take place on April 12th, the day before the
 <a href="http://www.zb2005.org">ZB conference</a> at
 the University of Surrey, Guildford, UK.</p>

<ul>
 <li>5th January, 2005 - paper submission</li>
 <li>1st February, 2005 - author notification</li>
 <li>15th March, 2005 - final papers due</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Papers should be submitted in Postscript or PDF format by e-mail to
 reach 
<a href="mailto:J.Derrick@dcs.shef.ac.uk">John Derrick</a> by 
5 January, 2005.
 They should be no longer than 16 pages (A4, using a 10pt font).</p>

<h2>History of the workshop</h2>

<p>This workshop continues a long tradition in refinement workshops run under the
 auspices of the British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest
 group. Running since 1988, previous refinement workshops have been held at
 Cambridge, London, Bath etc.</p>

<p>In 1998 the BCS refinement workshop was combined with the Australasian
 Refinement Workshop to form the International Refinement Workshop, hosted at
 alongside Formal Methods Pacific 1998 at The Australian National University.
</p>

<p>In 2002, the Refinement Workshop was held as an FME workshop in
 Copenhagen. Proceedings appeared in ENTCS Vol.70(3), and a special issue
 of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal based on the workshop appeared
 in 2003 (Vol. 15:1-2).</p>

<p>The Workshop Webpage will be available from 
<a href="http://www.refinenet.org.uk">www.refinenet.org.uk</a></p>
