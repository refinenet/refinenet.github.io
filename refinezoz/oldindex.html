<H1>Refinement of State Based Systems</H1>

<H2>Book</H2>
We are preparing a book entitled <b>Refinement
in Z and Object-Z: Foundations and Advanced Applications</b>, planned to
appear in the Springer FACIT series in Spring 2001.
<p>
An overview of many of the generalisations of refinement to be discussed
in the book is given in "<a href="/pubs/2000/1023">Liberating Data Refinement</a>", presented at MPC 2000.
<H2>Why and how?</h2>
One could consider the Refinement research a spin-off of our
research in the <a
href="http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/research/tcs/consistency/">Cross
Viewpoint Consistency in Open Distributed Processing</a> ("Consistency")
project (Bowman, Derrick, Boiten, Steen, Linington). In
this project we investigated how to define and check consistency for
specifications consisting of multiple interrelated viewpoints. As our
specification languages we used (Object-)Z and process algebra in the
form of LOTOS. For various reasons, including traceability (see
"<a href="http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/research/groups/tcs/consistency/tse.html">Managing
Inconsistency and Promoting Consistency</a>") it appeared that
<i>development</i> relations between specifications provide a better
basis for consistency checking than the logical definition. 
Consistency is defined as the existence of a specification which is a
development of each of the viewpoint specifications.
Of course, <i>refinement</i> is a prime example of such a development
relation.
<P>
A selection of relevant general papers (more on the

<a href="/research/tcs/openviews/">OpenViews</a> and
<a href="/research/tcs/framework/">A Constructive Framework for Partial
Specification</a>):
<UL>
<LI>"<a href="/pubs/1996/183">Viewpoint Consistency in ODP</a>" gives an
introduction to consistency based on development relations.
<LI>"<a href="/pubs/1996/181">Issues in Multiparadigm Viewpoint
Specification</a>" gives a fairly informal overview of the Consistency
project.
<LI>"<a href="/pubs/1997/182">Viewpoint consistency in Z and LOTOS: A
case study</a>" is a more formal overview using a case study.
<li><strong>(new)</strong>"<a href="/pubs/2000/1064">A Case Study in
Partial Specification</a>" is a recent case study in Object-Z, listing
requirements for advanced refinement relations.
</UL>
<H2>Refinement as Semantics</H2>
A crucial observation is that if we take consistency to be the existence
of a common development, implicitly we have taken as the semantics of a
specification the collection of all its refinements. In other words: the
refinement relation we use determines what a (partial) specification
<i>means</i>.
<p>
A consequence of this is that if we want to change our interpretation of
partial specifications, we have to change our refinement relation. A
major part of our subsequent work has been concerned with exactly that.

<H2>Constructive Refinement</H2>
<p>
One way of establishing constructively that two specifications
<i>are</i> consistent is to exhibit a common development of them.
Moreover, for consistency checking with further specifications, it is
important that this common development is the ``most abstract" one. Such
a most abstract (or <i>least</i> developed) common refinement we have called a
<i>unification</i>. 
<p>
We have investigated unifications for specifications in Z and in LOTOS.
<ul>
<li>In "<a href="/pubs/1995/188">Viewpoints and Objects</a>" we
presented an informal construction of unifications for Z. This can also
be found in other early papers of the Consistency project -  this one
also connects to the idea of <i>inheritance</i> as refinement.
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1996/192/">Consistency and Refinement for Partial
Specification in Z</a>" formalises the construction, fills in the
details, and contains the proofs. An (even further) extended version has
appeared in Science of Computer Programming as
"<a href="/pubs/1999/607/">Constructive consistency checking for partial
specification in Z</a>".
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1997/228/">Coupling Schemas: Data Refinement and
View(point) Composition</a>" explores the relation between unification,
refinement, and "view composition", a simpler syntactic composition
of specifications in Z.
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1995/185/">Composition of LOTOS Specifications</a>"
demonstrates how, on the other hand, in process algebras, with their
various development relations, it is generally impossible to define
unifications at the <i>syntactic</i> level.
</ul>
The papers on Z listed above demonstrate that it is possible to 
describe syntactically
<ul>
<li>the least common refinement of two specifications, given a
description of how they relate;
<li>the least data refinement of a specification, given a relation
between concrete and abstract state spaces.
</ul>
However, they are restricted to what is called <i>forwards</i> (or
downwards) simulation refinement. The semantic characterisation of
refinement implies that for completeness one needs <i>backwards</i>
simulation refinement as well.
<ul>
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1999/746/">Calculating upward and downward
simulations of state-based specifications</a>" gives constructions
for both forwards
and backwards simulation least data refinement.
</ul>

<H2>Constructive Refinement of Tests</H2>
Techniques exist for generating test cases from state based specifications.
In "<a href="/pubs/1998/609">Testing Refinements by Refining Tests</a>"
(which won joint best paper at ZUM'98)
we employ the techniques for
calculating data refinements to generate tests for a refined
specification by refining the test for the original specification.
An extended version of this has been published as
"<a href="/pubs/1999/747">Testing refinements of state-based formal
specifications</a>".

<H2>Relating Behaviour and State, and Weak Refinement</H2>
Our interest in relating behavioural and state based formalisms also
derives from the Consistency project: specifications may be written
using combinations of behavioural and state based formalisms.
There are essentially two ways of dealing with this.
<ul>
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1997/539/">Refinement and Verification of Concurrent
Systems Specified in Object-Z and CSP</a>" (Graeme Smith &amp; John
Derrick) shows how a behavioural notation can be used to provide an
extra layer of structure on top of a state based specification.
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1996/193/">Translating LOTOS into Z</a>" and 
"<a href="/pubs/1997/348/">Translating LOTOS to Object-Z" (extended
journal version)</a> support an
approach where specifications in both can coexist, and need to be
translated in order to check consistency.
<li>In both of these approaches, one needs to ensure compatibility of
semantics. In the viewpoints approach, this boils down to compatibility
of development relations, which is explored in 
"<a href="/pubs/1996/194/">Comparing LOTOS and Z Refinement
Relations</a>".
</ul>
However, Z lacks one important feature of process algebras which is
often needed for specification of concurrent systems: the
<i>internal</i> operation.
<ul>
<li>"<a href="/pubs/1997/190/">Weak Refinement in Z</a>" provides an
interpretation of internal operations in Z by defining a "weak"
refinement relation for specifications that may contain internal
operations. An extended version of this, "<a
href="/pubs/1998/648/">Specifying and Refining internal operations in Z</a>",
has appeared in Formal Aspects of Computing.
</ul>

<H2>Interface Refinement</H2>
Standard refinement in Z does not allow changes in input and output
parameters of operations. "<a href="/pubs/1998/608/">IO-Refinement in Z</a>"
gives a long list of reasons (including object orientation
and viewpoint specification)
why it would be desirable to allow this. Then it shows how the required
more liberal refinement relation can actually be derived from the semantic
characterisation.

<H2>Refinement and Decomposition</h2>
"<a href="/pubs/1999/816">Separating component and context specification
using promotion</a>" describes how refinement between 
specifications can be preserved when these specifications are considered
in larger contexts, created either by <i>promotion</i> or higher level
structuring provided by a process algebra like CSP.
<p>
"<a href="http:/pubs/1999/912">Non-atomic refinement in Z</a>"
describes a first
investigation into refinement relations for Z that do not require every
abstract operation to be matched by exactly one concrete operation.
<H2>Grey Box Refinement</H2>
"<a href="http:/pubs/1998/613/">Grey Box Data Refinement</a>" presents
a generalisation of data
refinement which takes into account that certain components of the state
are <i>visible</i>. This is done by interpreting these so-called 
<i>grey box</i> specifications as ordinary ("black box") specifications
with additional operations, and simplifying the traditional refinement
conditions for those.
