Bibliographical Notes
</H1>

<P>
The use of internal operations in Z is not new, representative examples
include 
[<A
 HREF="node45.html#Cusack92a">55</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#wezeman">205</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Rafsan94">168</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Strulo95">197</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Woodcock96">209</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Derrick96a">67</A>].  
For example, Strulo [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Strulo95">197</A>] considers the use of Z in network
management and 
describes the need for both observable and internal operations in this
application area. A particular example is described of a network manager's view
of a router within a network. There, alarm notifications are a typical example
of internal events which are specified as usual but with informal commentary
describing which operations are observable and which are internal. A similar
approach and application area is described by Wezeman and Judge in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#wezeman">205</A>] and
Rafsanjani in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Rafsan94">168</A>].

<P>
Cusack and Wezeman in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Cusack92a">55</A>] adopt a number of conventions for the
use of Z for 
the specification of OSI network management standards. In particular, they make
the distinction between internal and observable operations according to whether
an operation has input/output, all operations without input or output variables
are considered internal, all others are observable. 
Their work is placed in an object-oriented setting and they consider notions
of subtyping based upon conformance instead of refinement. 

<P>
Evans in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Evans97a">81</A>] considers the use of Z for the specification
of parallel systems, and in particular discusses issues of liveness and
fairness in dynamic
specifications. Informal commentary partitions the specification into internal
and observable operations, and
Evans considers the refinement relations needed for Z specifications of
concurrent systems.

<P>
Similar work to that described in this chapter has appeared in other
state-based formalisms. For example,  
Butler [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Butler97a">43</A>]
considers the specification and refinement of internal actions in the
B<A NAME="641"></A> method. 
The email specification in Example 11.2.5above is adapted from
a B specification given in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Butler99a">45</A>].
Additional work in this area also includes the work of Lano,
e.g., [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Lano97a">142</A>], and the time service example has been specified in B in
[<A
 HREF="node45.html#Lano99a">143</A>].
The work described in this chapter first appeared in
[<A
 HREF="node45.html#Derrick98a">69</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Derrick97a">68</A>].

<P>
Other formalisms, such as TLA<A NAME="646"></A> and automata<A NAME="647"></A>, 
have a long history of
using stuttering steps to verify refinements involving internal actions, see,
for example, [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Abadi91">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Lynch93">185</A>]. 
These languages take a different approach to the introduction of livelock by
using fairness criteria on the observable operations. 
For example, in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Lynch93">185</A>] liveness conditions are used to describe which
executions of the automaton are considered to represent a properly working
system. 
The use of such liveness conditions or fairness criteria provide a language
which is strictly more expressive than Z, since we cannot write a Z
specification with an infinitely often enabled internal operation that does
not involve livelock. 

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Lynch93">185</A>] Sogaard-Andersen, Lynch and Lampson demonstrate the
correctness of reliable 
at-most-once message delivery protocols using timed I/O automata.
In particular, two protocol refinements are verified: a clock-based protocol
and a five-packet handshake protocol.
The verification of these refinements is split into a number of stages, with
the two implementations being downward simulations of an intermediate
description, which itself is an upward simulation of the original problem
specification.

<P>
In addition to its size, the case study is interesting because it is necessary
to use an upward simulation in the verification. It also verifies a timed
model (the clock 
protocol) against the untimed problem statement by using  various embedding
results to move between the models.
The specifications in Example 11.4.1are simplified versions
of parts of this case study.

<P>
Stuttering steps have also been used in action systems<A NAME="651"></A> 
[<A
 HREF="node45.html#Back89a">13</A>,<A
 HREF="node45.html#Back88a">12</A>] to verify refinements with internal actions.
Back and von Wright in [<A
 HREF="node45.html#Back94a">14</A>] define refinement in terms of the
execution 
traces of an action system. Forward and backward simulation methods are then
described which explicitly deal with internal (i.e., stuttering) actions.
