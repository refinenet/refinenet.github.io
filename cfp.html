<p>
Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal
approach to software engineering: the process of developing a more
detailed design or implementation from an abstract specification
through a sequence of steps that maintain
correctness with respect to the original specification. Refinement
forms the foundation for verification in a range of application areas,
including distributed and concurrent systems, cyber-physical systems,
autonomous systems, and other safety-critical applications.  
<p> 
 

The aim of this <a href="http://www.bcs-facs.org/">BCS FACS</a>
Refinement Workshop is to bring
together people who are interested in the development of more concrete
designs or executable programs from abstract specifications using
formal notations, tool support for formal software development, and
practical experience with formal refinement methodologies. 
<p>

The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, and discussion of common ground and key differences.
Topics of interest include:

<ul>
  <li> Simulation techniques
  <li> Foundations and semantics
  <li> Case studies (specification and verification)
  <li> Compositional and modular reasoning
  <li> Object-orientation
  <li> Time, probability and hybrid systems
  <li> Specification notations
  <li> Programming models
  <li> Verification and tool support
  <li> Refinement and testing
</ul>

<h2> Proceedings </h2>

Papers are fully refereed prior to the workshop will be published
in <a href="http://about.eptcs.org">Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)</a>, an open-access publisher.
<p>

It is anticipated that selected papers from this workshop will be
published in extended versions in a special edition of a major
international journal, in line with the special issues in FACJ and SCP
that have appeared for workshop editions since 2003.   


<h2>Key dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Paper submission: April 23rd, 2018
  <li>Notification: May 28th, 2018
  <li>Workshop: July 18th, 2018
</ul>


<h2> Submission </h2>

Accepted papers will need to use the EPTCS format,
see <a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">EPTCS info for authors</a>. Papers should be no more than 16 pages.
<p>
Submissions can be made via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=refine2018">EasyChair</a>.

<h2>History of the workshop
</h2>


This is the 18th Refinement Workshop and would continue a long
tradition in refinement workshops run under the auspices of the
British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest group. Running
since 1988, previous refinement workshops have been held at Cambridge,
London, Bath etc. 
<p>
 

In 1998 the BCS refinement workshop was combined with the Australasian
Refinement Workshop to form the International Refinement Workshop,
hosted alongside Formal Methods Pacific 1998 at The Australian
National University. In 2002, the Refinement Workshop was held as an
FME workshop in Copenhagen. This and six subsequent editions (Surrey,
Macau, Oxford, Turku, Eindhoven, Limerick) have had proceedings in
ENTCS or EPTCS and a subsequent journal special issue (most in Formal
Aspects of Computing, one in Science of Computer Programming). 
<p>
 

The workshop has been co-located at a number of different conferences
in its history, most recently at FM in 2015 (Norway), iFM in 2013
(Pisa) and FM2011 (Limerick).
