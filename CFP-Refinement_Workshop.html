<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Monday 2nd July 2007 - co-located with IFM 2007 - 
St Anne's College, Oxford<BR>REFINE 
2007 - International Refinement Workshop </P>
<HR>

<P>Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal approach to software 
engineering: the process of developing a more detailed design or implementation 
from an abstract specification through a sequence of mathematically-based steps 
that maintain correctness with respect to the original specification.</P>
<P>The aim of this Refinement Workshop is to 
bring together people who are interested in the development of more concrete 
designs or executable programs from abstract specifications using formal 
notations, tool support for formal software development, and practical 
experience with formal refinement methodologies. The workshop is organized by <A href="http://www.refinenet.org.uk/">RefineNet network</A>, 
a British network funded by the EPSRC, with the support of BCS FACS.</P>
<P>The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, 
and discussion of common ground and key differences.</P>
<P>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Simulation techniques 
  <LI>Foundations and semantics 
  <LI>Case studies (specification and verification) 
  <LI>Compositional and modular reasoning 
  <LI>Object-orientation 
  <LI>Time 
  <LI>Specification notations 
  <LI>Programming models 
  <LI>Verification and tool support </LI></UL>
<H2>Proceedings</H2>
<P>Submissions will be reviewed, and workshop proceedings will appear in 
<a href="http://www.entcs.org">Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)</a>.
  BCS-FACS will provide a best paper prize.
  Special issues of &quot;Formal Aspects of Computing&quot; journal have 
been produced containing extended papers from the last few refinement workshops.
  A similar arrangement is envisaged for the 2007 edition. These would 
be refereed in the usual fashion prior to acceptance by the journal.</P>
<H2>Key Dates</H2>
<P>The Refinement workshop will take place on Monday 2nd July 2007, as one of the 
workshops of&nbsp; the <a href="http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/ifm2007/">IFM 2007 
conference</a> organised by the
<a target="blank" href="http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/">University of Oxford</a>.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>4th May, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - paper submission</LI> 
  <LI>25th May, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp; - author notification </LI> 
  <LI>8th June, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - final papers due </LI></UL>
<H2>Submissions</H2>
<P>Papers should be submitted in ENTCS style in Postscript or PDF format by e-mail
  to reach <A href="mailto:J.Derrick@dcs.shef.ac.uk">John Derrick</A> by 4th May, 2007.
  They should be no longer than 25 pages prepared using the ENTCS macros
  (available from the table given
  <a href="http://www.entcs.org/table.html">here</a>).
  As usual, authors are advised to use the file <code>example.tex</code> that's
  included in the generic ENTCS macro package (see
  <a href="http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html">information and instructions</a>) as a
  template for their papers.
</P>
  <H2>History of the workshop</H2>
<P>This workshop continues a long tradition in refinement workshops run under 
the auspices of the British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest group. 
Running since 1988, previous refinement workshops have been held at Cambridge, 
London, Bath etc.</P>
<P>In 1998 the BCS refinement workshop was combined with the Australasian 
Refinement Workshop to form the International Refinement Workshop, hosted at 
alongside Formal Methods Pacific 1998 at The Australian National University. 
</P>
<P>In 2002, the Refinement Workshop was held as an FME workshop in Copenhagen. 
Proceedings appeared in ENTCS Vol.70(3), and a special issue of the Formal 
Aspects of Computing journal based on the workshop appeared in 2003 (Vol. 
15:1-2). In 2005, the workshop was co-located with the
<a href="http://www.zb2005.org/">ZB conference</a> held at the University of 
Surrey, Guildford. Proceedings appeared in ENTCS Vol.137(2), and a special issue of the Formal 
Aspects of Computing journal containing extensions of a number of papers  
appeared in 2006 (Vol. 18:3). In 2006, the workshop was co-located with the
<a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/icfem06/">ICFEM conference</a> organised by the
<a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu" target="blank">UNU-IIST</a> and the
<a href="http://www.umac.mo" target="blank">University of Macau</a>, proceedings 
will appear soon in ENTCS, and a special issue of the Formal Aspects of 
Computing journal is under preparation.</P>
