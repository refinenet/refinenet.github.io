<hr/>

<p style="text-align:center;">
 3 November 2009, as part of <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/fmweek/">FM Week 2009</a> at Eindhoven
</p>
(Note: earlier incorrectly announced as 2 November)
<hr/>

<p>Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal approach to software
 engineering: the process of developing a more detailed design or
 implementation from an abstract specification through a sequence of
 mathematically-based steps that maintain correctness with respect to the
 original specification.</p>

<p>The aim of this BCS FACS Refinement Workshop, 
 is to bring together
 people who are interested in the development of more concrete designs or
 executable programs from abstract specifications using formal notations,
 tool support for formal software development, and practical experience
 with formal refinement methodologies.</p>

<p>The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of 
ideas, and discussion of common ground and key differences.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Simulation techniques</li>
<li>Foundations and semantics</li>
<li>Case studies (specification and verification)</li>
<li>Compositional and modular reasoning</li>
<li>Object-orientation</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Specification notations</li>
<li>Programming models</li>
<li>Verification and tool support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proceedings</h2>

<p> Submissions will be reviewed, workshop proceedings will
appear in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.
 A special issue of Formal Aspects
 of Computing will be produced afterwards, consisting of developments and
 extensions of workshop papers. These would be refereed in the
 usual fashion prior to acceptance by the journal.</p>

<h2>Key Dates</h2>

<p>The Refinement workshop will take place on November 3rd, 
 as part of FM'09 at Eindhoven</p>

<ul>
 <li>1st August, 2009 - paper submission</li>
 <li>15th September, 2009 - author notification</li>
 <li>15th October, 2009 - final papers due</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Invited Speaker</h2>
Carroll Morgan has kindly agreed to speak at Refine 2009, tentative
title: <i>How to cook-up a refinement ordering</i>.

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Papers should be submitted in Postscript or PDF format by e-mail to
 reach 
<a href="mailto:J.Derrick@dcs.shef.ac.uk">John Derrick</a> by 
1st August, 2009.
 They should be no longer than 16 pages (A4, using a 10pt font).</p>

<h2>History of the workshop</h2>

<p>This workshop continues a long tradition in refinement workshops run under the
 auspices of the British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest
 group. Running since 1988, previous refinement workshops have been held at
 Cambridge, London, Bath etc.</p>

<p>In 1998 the BCS refinement workshop was combined with the Australasian
 Refinement Workshop to form the International Refinement Workshop, hosted 
 alongside Formal Methods Pacific 1998 at The Australian National University.
In 2002, the Refinement Workshop was held as an FME workshop in
 Copenhagen. Proceedings appeared in ENTCS Vol.70(3), and a special issue
 of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal based on the workshop appeared
 in 2003 (Vol. 15:1-2). In 2005, the workshop was co-located with the ZB
 conference held at the University of Surrey. Proceedings appeared in
 ENTCS Vol.137(2), and a special issue of Formal Aspects of Computing
 based on it appeared in 2006 (Vol. 18:3). In 2006, the workshop was
 co-located with the ICFEM conference at Macau, published in ENTCS
 Vol.187(1), and the corresponding special issue of Formal Aspects
 of Computing has just come out (Vol. 21:1-2). The 2007 edition was
 co-located with IFM at Oxford, with proceedings in ENTCS Vol.201, and
 extended papers to appear in Formal Aspects of Computing journal soon.
 In 2008, the Refinement Workshop was co-located with FME at Turku,
 with proceedings in ENTCS Vol. 214 and a special issue of Science of
 Computer Programming currently in preparation.
