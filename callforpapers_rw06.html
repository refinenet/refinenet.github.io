<p style="text-align:center;">
31 October 2006, co-located with ICFEM 2006 
<br/>REFINE 2006 - International refinement workshop.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal approach to software engineering: the process of developing a more detailed design or implementation from an abstract specification through a sequence of mathematically-based steps that maintain correctness with respect to the original specification.</p>

<p>The aim of this Refinement Workshop is to bring together people who are interested in the development of more concrete designs or executable programs from abstract specifications using formal notations, tool support for formal software development, and practical experience with formal refinement methodologies. The workshop is organized by RefineNet network, a British network funded by the EPSRC, with the support of BCS FACS.</p>

<p>The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, and discussion of common ground and key differences.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Simulation techniques</li>
<li>Foundations and semantics</li>
<li>Case studies (specification and verification)</li>
<li>Compositional and modular reasoning</li>
<li>Object-orientation</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Specification notations</li>
<li>Programming models</li>
<li>Verification and tool support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proceedings</h2>

<p>Submissions will be reviewed, and workshop proceedings will appear in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS). BCS-FACS will provide a best paper prize. Special issues of "Formal Aspects of Computing" journal have been produced containing extended papers from each of the last two refinement workshops.A similar arrangement is envisaged for the 2006 edition. These would be refereed in the usual fashion prior to acceptance by the journal.</p>

<h2>Key Dates</h2>

<p>The Refinement workshop will take place on October 31st, as one of the workshops of  the 
<a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/icfem06/">ICFEM 2006</a> conference 
organised by the <a href="http://www.iist.unu.edu/">UNU-IIST</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.umac.mo/">University of Macau</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>26th June, 2006 - paper submission</li>
<li>17th July, 2006 - author notification</li>
<li>11th August, 2006 - final papers due</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Papers should be submitted in ENTCS style in Postscript or PDF format by e-mail to reach <a href="mailto:jd@dcs.shef.ac.uk">John Derrick</a> by 26th June, 2006. They should be no longer than 16 pages (A4, using a 10pt font).</p>

<h2>History of the workshop</h2>

<p>This workshop continues a long tradition in refinement workshops run under the auspices of the British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest group. Running since 1988, previous refinement workshops have been held at Cambridge, London, Bath etc.</p>

<p>In 1998 the BCS refinement workshop was combined with the Australasian Refinement Workshop to form the International Refinement Workshop, hosted at alongside Formal Methods Pacific 1998 at The Australian National University.</p>

<p>In 2002, the Refinement Workshop was held as an FME workshop in Copenhagen. Proceedings appeared in ENTCS Vol.70(3), and a special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal based on the workshop appeared in 2003 (Vol. 15:1-2). In 2005, the workshop was co-located with the 
<a href="http://www.zb2005.org/">ZB</a> conference held at the University of Surrey, Guildford. Proceedings appeared in ENTCS Vol.137(2), and a special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal containing extensions of a number of papers will appear soon.</p>

<p>The Workshop Webpage will be available from
